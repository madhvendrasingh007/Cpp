    // Polymorphism
    // Polymorphism is an ability of a C++ object to take many forms.The most important use of polymorphism in C++ OOPs occurs when we want to bind functions to the objects we defined in C++ during compile-time or run-time.
    //  - one name and multiple forms
    //  - eg. Function overloading, operator overloading
    //  - eg. Virtual Functions
    /*
    Polymorphism in C++ can be of two types:
    1. Compile time polymorphism
       Compile time polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
        1.1 - Function overloading
        1.2 - Operator Overloading
    2. Run time polymorphism
       Run time polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
        2.1 - Virtual functions
